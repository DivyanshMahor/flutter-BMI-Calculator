# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A simple BMI calculator application built with Flutter. This application allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by inputting their weight and height.

## Style, Design, and Features

*   **Framework:** Flutter
*   **UI:** Material Design
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Input fields for weight (in kg) and height (in feet and inches).
    *   Calculates BMI and displays the result.
    *   Provides a message indicating if the user is underweight, healthy, or overweight.
    *   The background color of the application changes based on the BMI result.

## Current Task

**Goal:** Improve the visual design and user experience of the BMI calculator app.

**Plan:**

1.  **Enhance Typography:** Incorporate the `google_fonts` package to use more expressive and readable fonts.
2.  **Improve Result Display:**
    *   Instead of changing the entire background color, display the BMI result in a styled `Card` widget.
    *   Use distinct colors for the result card to represent underweight, healthy, and overweight statuses.
    *   Include relevant icons in the result display to provide better visual cues.
3.  **Refine Layout:** Adjust the layout and spacing of UI elements for a cleaner and more organized look.
4.  **Code Refactoring:** Clean up the code and remove commented-out sections.
